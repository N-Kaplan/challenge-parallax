## The Mission
Positioning images over each other in the right order to get a pretty background. Animate each piece based on how far it is in the background. The first layer (the ground) will move fastest, the last (the sky) will be static.

## Must-have features

- A page with a moving background that looks natural

- Something of your personal choosing to enhance the page, go take a look at the suggestions or come up with something yourself!

## Suggestions
- Make a platform game / endless runner

- Make an infomercial for the environment (or anything else)

- Make your own images to use for the parallax

- Enhance the scenery with some characters

- Make a short movie, you can stop the scroller or make it go in any direction and add some characters

- ANYTHING REALLY!! (Go chat it up with your coach if you want some approval!)
